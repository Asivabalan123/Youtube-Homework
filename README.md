# Youtube-Homework

In this project HTML and CSS was used to create a youtube page. HTML is the language in which you define the structure of the content of your pages (e.g. headings, paragraphs, links and images).

CSS is used to write down how everything should look (e.g. font sizes, colors and positions).
