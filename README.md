# Youtube-Homework

In this project HTML and CSS was used to create the youtube home page. HTML is the language in which you define the structure of the content of your pages (e.g. headings, paragraphs, links and images).

CSS is used to write down how everything should look (e.g. font sizes, colors and positions).

To view the HTML page, git clone the repository and open the index.html link.
